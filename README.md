# oas
The OAS application is a mobile centric application which connects the conventional art market with the new NFT world. The objective is to have a easy to use mobile application which allows artists(as well as other players in the market) to create/management and exchange/trade their artworks with NFT(via high resolution image upload). This would create a completely traceable history of any artwork.
